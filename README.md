Bob and Carol should have been having better communication when they were pushing to master.
Then they had the audacity to not pull from master after they merged which ended up with them having
further conflicts.

Moving forward they need to communicate better with their team members so they are not doubling their efforts and to prevent merge conflicts before they appear.

moral of the story here is communicate communicate communicate!!!!
